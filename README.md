# VeganIpsum API ❤️🐄🐓🐑🐟

Powered by Node, Express, Pug and Bulma

VeganIpsum API is a LoremIpsum text generator that uses vegan-friendly terms. It comprises:
 - A back-end consisting of an API serving different endpoints to generate random and selective output.
 - A front-end site hosting information and a random text generator.

## Pending

  I'm considering moving the database of words to MongoDB to allow CRUD operations.

## Instructions

You can use this app in different ways:

### The Vegan Ipsum generator.

- Go to https://www.veganipsum.co or click on the Generator 🤖 link from the Navigation links.

- Pick how many words you want your random text to contain (10, 15 or 20), click on "Generate random text" and voila!
Additionaly you can click on the "Copy" button to copy the generated text right into your clipboard.

### The Vegan Ipsum API.

You can build your request URL the following way

Base URL is `https://www.veganipsum.co/api`

### Endpoints:

`/eggs`, `/meat`,`/cheese`,`/grains`,`/brands` will each return a JSON containing a list of terms.

You can browse the endpoints directly in the browser or make a http call to retrieve the words.

For example, browsing to `https://www.veganipsum.co/api/cheese` will give you the following output:

```javascript
{
    0: "daiya",
    1: "follow your heart ",
    2: "teese",
    3: "sheese ",
    4: "vegan rella",
    5: "cheezly ",
    6: "parma",
    7: "soymage vegan parmesan "
}
```

You can get a full list of the terms at the `/full-list` endpoint.
